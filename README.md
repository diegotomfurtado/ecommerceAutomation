# Challenge: ecommerceAutomation

It's a project created by myself to show how I've been building UI automation. I've been programming with JAVA + Selenium WeBdriver + Page Object. 
#### _I haven't finished yet! :)_

## Goals:

Use the [e-commerce site](http://automationpractice.com/index.php) (free website for automation studies), where you will test the validation test: user authentication, creation of a new user and purchase of items.

## What is important for the Client

* The security of the users' information;
* Ensure all registered information is saved correctly;
* The client will have possibility of items purchase;
* Possibility to reopen a purchase already completed and to increase a new items;

## Running Tests

If you want to see how it's working, just fork this project on your local machine and build in your workspace. It's really easy! :)

### Prerequisites for all tests to be successful
